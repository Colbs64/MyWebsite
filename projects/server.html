        <p class="project-text">
            I've wanted to make a server setup in the past, but now that I've got
            an extra computer I can use, I just decided to go for it.

        <h3 class="project-title">Goals</h3>

                Docker
            </li>
            <p>
                Learning Docker wasn't my initial intent, but I wanted to find a way that
                I can easily control the resources I can give each program. Docker was
                perfect for this as I could limit RAM and core-count to each docker container
                using docker-compose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Docker also allowed me to easily start/stop/restart services and use seperate users for
                services to implement the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/principle-of-least-privilege/"

                Jellyfin service
            </li>
            <p>
                Jellyfin is an open-source alternative to Plex, I've been wanting to try it out to be able
                to stream my movies on all my devices.

                Running game servers
            </li>
            <p>
                The 2 games I wanted to try out are Minecraft and Satisfactory. I've ran a Minecraft
                server locally before, but I wanted to know what the performance would be like running
                it virtualized in a docker container.
