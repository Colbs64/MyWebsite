            I've wanted to make a server setup in the past, but now that I've
            got an extra computer I can use, I just decided to go for it. I had
            some initial goals for this project, but on the way, I learned about
            Docker, docker-compose, and Linux user and group permissions.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
            I decided to go with Debian, because it's more of a batteries
            included distro that has a very easy setup process dedicated for an
            SSH server. Since I have two drives, I edited the /etc/fstab file to
            include my hard drive on /home/colby/drive2. The OS was installed on
            the SSD.

            <p>
                Learning Docker wasn't my initial intent, but I wanted to find a
                way that I can easily control the resources I can give each
                program. Docker was perfect for this as I could limit RAM and
                core-count to each docker container using docker-compose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Docker also allowed me to easily start/stop/restart services and
                use seperate users for services to implement the

            <p>
                Jellyfin is an open-source alternative to Plex, I've been
                wanting to try it out to be able to stream my movies on all my
                devices.

                The 2 games I wanted to try out are Minecraft and Satisfactory.
                I've ran a Minecraft server locally before, but I wanted to know
                what the performance would be like running it virtualized in a
                docker container.

            This computer is just some random Dell bought off Ebay, I initially
            bought it to throw a graphics card inside it as a gift for my
            brother, I think for around $100 at the time. Now, he has my old
            build, so he let me have this back. The specs aren't incredible, but
            this is perfect a small home server.

        <h3 class="project-title">Docker</h3>
        <p class="project-text">
            Since this was gonna be my server project, I wanted a way I can make
            this system more secure and easier to manage. To make this system
            more secure, I used <em>'sudo useradd -m NAME'</em>
            to create a new user with it's own home directory in /home/USERNAME.
            I then went into /etc/passwd and change the last line of each of
            these docker users from /bin/bash to /bin/nologin. This makes it so
            that a real user cannot login to these accounts, only programs can
            use them to run processes, which is what I want.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
            The reason I gave the users Home directories is so that they can
            access files that I provide. I needed this for Jellyfin so that it
            can read my movies and for game services to have a place to store
            settings and savefiles. I could've just added these folders into my
            home directory, but I think having these seperate home directories
            makes it easier to sort and manage permissions.

            For the Docker containers, there ended up being very good pre-made
            containers on
            <a href="https://hub.docker.com" target="_blank"> docker hub.</a> I
            used 3 different containers for

        <p class="project-text">
            Jellyfin worked pretty seamlessly, all I had to do was define it's
            user in the docker-compose.yaml file with
            <em>user: UID:GID</em>, tell it which folders my movies are stored
            in, and it mostly auto-detected everything. Although, I did have to
            format all of these video names beforehand, I have a picture of what
            that looks like

            src="../IMG/File-format.png"
        />
        <p class="project-text">
            I didn't limit any of the processing because of how weak my cpu is,
            it actually pins all cores to 70%-95% usage when I stream video. But
            it does work at the very least.

        <p class="project-text">
            My one issue with Jellyfin is that my subtitles on shows keep going out of sync.
            I still haven't found a fix, and I honestly have no idea why it's doing that. Other
            than that, streaming has been perfect. Just hoping to possibly get a spare GPU to
            dedicate to transcoding the video to the users on the network.

        <h3 class="bold project-title">Video game servers</h3>

        <p class="project-text">
            I initially started this project because of satisfactory, I wasn't having any FPS
            issues, but I heard online that a dedicated server is very good for the game once
            you start building bigger factories because it takes some of the load from your
            computer and lets the server handle it. It actually worked very well, I got a
            10-20+ FPS increase, that's pretty significant, although, I was already getting
            130-150 before that.
        </p>

        <p class="project-text">
            Minecraft is about the same story. Although, running a dedicated server didn't improve
            my games performance, it's still nice to have a dedicated server as it allows finer
            control over configuration of a world and user permissions.

        <h3 class="bold project-title">Wrap up</h3>

        <p class="project-text">
            This project was pretty fun, and since I have previous experience with Linux, it only
            took about 3 days to get fully running. I really loved working with Docker, it made
            managing my services a lot easier as I could just use <em>docker ps</em> to see what
            containers were running at that current moment, how long they have been running, and
            what ports they were using.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
            Overall, this project was very fun, and I do plan on either building a better server in
            the future, or try to add more services to this one. I want to have a NAS, but this
            server really doesn't have the storage to act as one. I'm hoping to have a seperate
            NAS with at least 8TB of storage in the future, maybe 16TB just so that I can use
            raid 1 for redundancy.
